# nano-uiua-config

Adds what we all need in life, [nano](nano-editor.org) support for [uiua](uiua.org)  
To format type `^T^O`  
Due to the fact that nano does not (and does not need to) implement the Language Server Protocol, function highlighting based on adicty and fancy things like that aren't supported  
Requires having the nano editor installed  

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/cqn-brwpna9/nano-uiua-config
cd nano-uiua-config
sudo chown root uiua.nanorc
sudo ln ./uiua.nanorc /usr/share/nano
```
